      "description":"I'm a university student. Pretty obvious from the title of this article, I know. The one who has always managed to back the top position of her class ever since middle school, along with managing a blog, medium, a publication, a Pinterest account and other sites.I know, I know. You don't care about my grades, or the type of work I get done in a week—but bear with me for a while.The thing is my fellow mates always, quite literally, always ask me questions like “ how much do you study to achieve those marks? You must study everyday, all night, or all time of the day.” On the contrary, the reality is that I don’t. I open my study material just a week before exams.Yes, you heard (read) me right. I’m very lazy to even look at my notes before that. My friends don’t believe me, my classmates don’t believe me and I don’t expect you to believe me either.What I do instead is, when I sit down to study, I study straight up for 5 hours without taking any break and manage to retain all the learned knowledge in my head for eternity. (Okay, that was too much but you got my point). "
